# Day 8 Journal

**Prompt**

_For this journal entry, no specific prompt other than to start off with "Today I learned..." or "Recently I learned..." and go from there._

**Response**

Recently I learned that having crazy long code is not necessarily a bad thing at first. It helps when trying to expain the process to others and it is easier to remember and explain again to myself what I was trying to accomplish.

Starting long also makes it easier to find a problem with the logic and debug.
