# Day 5 Journal

**Prompt**

_["Adults need to know why to learn something; as soon as they answer this question, they are ready to start."] (https://elearningindustry.com/pedagogy-vs-andragogy-in-elearning-can-you-tell-the-difference) In other words, the why applies to both large-scale (learning web development as a new profession) and small-scale (learning a particular tool or technique), and your learning journal is an excellent place to identify and contemplate those whys. They are important. So... what is your why?_

**Response**

I really don't think I understand this question. The why of why I am pursuing learning code is to get out of my current job, have the potential to earn more money. 

I enjoyed playing with CSS today to find out what tools are available to change the appearance of a website even though I still find floats impossible and there was probably a cleaner way to accomplish what I did while eliminating repetitive CSS.

Otherwise, I completely don't understand arrays or why you would want to splice a string. Usually a concept clicks when I can reconcile in my own head why this is important or why should I care about this from an applications point of view.
