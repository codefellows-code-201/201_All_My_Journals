# Day 12 Journal

**Prompt**

_There's an old saying: "Experience is what you get when you didn't get what you wanted." What strategies do you use for learning from disappointments (both big and small) so that the next experience becomes productive and positive?_

**Response**

I try not to dwell on mistakes. If I continually think "if I had only chosen that instead" my life would be different then I am preventing myself from being able to move forward.
