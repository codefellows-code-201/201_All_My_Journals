# Day 7 Journal

**Prompt**

_Motivation and goals are an important part of adult learning; so is adapting to and gaining insight from things you did not anticipate. What would you say is the most unexpected part of this experience, and how have you learned from it?_

**Response**

I knew when I started this process that it would be difficult to complete daily life tasks outside of school and that I would have to work hard at time management. In reallity it is harder to find the time to go grocery shopping, buy dog food, and do laundry than I expected. Generally having a late assignment (even without a penalty) stresses me out. I have had to give myself permission to just go to bed rather than staying up as late as needed to get the work done.

I have learned to identify what is truly important both to learn the material and to continue with daily life requirements.
