# Day 11 Journal

**Prompt**

_For this journal entry, no specific prompt other than to start off with "Today I learned..." or "Recently I learned..." and go from there._

**Response**

Recently I learned that wireframes are AWESOME! They provide a logical process for setting up the appearance of a webpage rather than the previous approach of "what happens when I do this"?
