# Day 6 Journal

**Prompt**

_["What motivates adults to find time for their learning in their busy schedule? Mostly intrinsic motivators."] (https://elearningindustry.com/pedagogy-vs-andragogy-in-elearning-can-you-tell-the-difference) In other words, adults are motivated by internal forces rather than by external expectations, and your learning journal provides an outlet for considering and noting those internal forces. Which of your internal forces for learning can you concretely identify?_

**Response**

I am not happy with where my career is currently and I see learning to code as an opportunity to provide a door into other possibilities.

I firmly believe that if you want something to change you need to take actions to make a change occur.
