# Class 3 Journal

**Prompt**

_"[[For adult learners,] their experience becomes the main resource of both their learning and the personal identity they have developed, as the richer and more diverse their experience, the more the diversity they can bring to their own learning."](https://elearningindustry.com/pedagogy-vs-andragogy-in-elearning-can-you-tell-the-difference) In other words, your life experience in learning the things you did before learning code will make this new experience more meaningful for you, and reflection on all of your experiences is essential in maximizing what you can gain from your study at Code Fellows. How do you think your prior life and professional experience will help you in this new endeavor?_

**Response**

I think my prior life experience in a science background makes me appreciate data and how data can be used. It also may help me more quickly understand the logic necessary in coding.

From a marketing perspective it has given me an understanding of what is desireable in a user interface and how functionality is equally (or more) important than aesthetics when looking for responses from users.
