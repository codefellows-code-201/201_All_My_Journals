# Day 10 Journal

**Prompt**
_[Read this short article](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/working-in-tech/imposter-syndrome/) on Imposter Syndrome. On a scale from 1 (least) to 10 (most), to what extent do you experience these feelings? Have you always felt the way you do now? If you have successfully lowered the number you'd use to rate your Imposter Syndrome, how have you done so?_

**Response**
I would currently rank my imposter syndrome at a 6. I think in some areas I have always struggled with this. Partially because I tend to compare my own achievements to the achievements of others. I don't know if I have lowered it over time since this is the first time I have ever had the feeling of inadequacy in a work environment explained in these terms.
