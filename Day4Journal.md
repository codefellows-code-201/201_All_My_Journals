# Day 4 Journal

**Prompt**

_["[Adult learners] demand that their learning is relevant to their real life issues, problems, and tasks, and that their education will boost their performance levels and help them live their lives in a better, and more satisfying way."] (https://elearningindustry.com/pedagogy-vs-andragogy-in-elearning-can-you-tell-the-difference)  In other words, understanding your motivation for learning contributes to the effectiveness of your learning, and your learning journal is a place to explore those thoughts. What are your motivations for learning?_

**Response**

My motivation for learning is not to get bored. I am always looking for a new project, new skill or something different to do. Some of those things like quilting, tend to go in spurts of interest.

Learning is also a stepping stone to change. Without a willingness to work towards learning something new change is not possible.
